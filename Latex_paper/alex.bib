Web services provide a platform independent concept of components and composition. Thus, they seem to be a proper technology to cover the heterogenous structures within distributed business processes: One Web service realizes a local subprocess. A distributed business process is realized by the composition of a set of Web services. Although the technological basement is given, there is a lot of open questions: Do two Web services fit together in a way, that the composition yields a deadlock-free system? - the question of compatibility. Can one Web service be exchanged by another within a composed system without running into problems? - the question of equivalence. Can we reason about the quality of one given Web service without considering the environment it will by used in? In this paper we present the notion of usability - our quality criterion of a Web service. This criterion is intuitive and can be easily proven locally. Moreover, this notion allows to answer the other questions mentioned above. The approach and the results presented in this paper are taken from a larger framework for modeling and analyzing business processes by help of Web services published in my PhD thesis [9].}

The Web Service approach provides group of technologies to describe components and their composition, based on well established protocols. Focused on business processes, one Web Service implements a local subprocess. A distributed business processes is implemented by the composition a set of communicating Web Services. At the moment, there are various modeling languages under development to describe the internal structure of one Web Service (e. g. Business Process Execution Language for Web Services BPEL4WS (BEA et al., 2002a)) and the choreography of a set of Web Services (e. g. Web Service Choreography Interface WSCI (BEA et al., 2002b)). Nevertheless, there is a need for methods for stepwise construction and verification of such components. This paper abstracts from concrete syntax of any proposed language definition. Instead, we apply Petri nets to model Web Services. Thus, we are able to reason about essential properties, e. g. usability of a Web Service - our notion of a quality criterion. Based on this framework, we present an algorithm to analyze a given Web Service and to transfer a complex process model into a appropriate model of a Web Service.}

On the one hand, the interaction between the participating companies often is specified globally, for example by means of multiple abstract process models - one for each partner. On the other hand, each partner defines its local process autonomously in terms of an executable process model. The important question is whether such an executable model is consistent to the predefined abstract model. This paper describes an approach to prove this property automatically.}

abstract = {The internet today has grown to be more than just being a basis for exchanging information. It steadily becomes a platform for processing business processes. Many companies distribute their service with the help of web services or integrate other web services into their own workflow. However, before a web service gets published it should be examined well. We will introduce a way of examining the controllability of a web service. That means, we study whether a controller can actually use the functionality provided by the web service. We propose the interaction graph of a web service, that is modelled by an open workflow net. To verify whether such a net is controllable or not it is sufficient to construct a reduced interaction graph. We will define reduction rules that minimize the size of the graph greatly. The analysis using the interaction graph as well as the reduction rules shown in this paper are implemented and have been integrated into an analysis tool kit for web services.}

    abstract ="Component adaptation is widely recognised to be one of the crucial
problems in Component-Based Software Engineering. The objective of this paper is
to set a formal foundation for the adaptation of heterogeneous components that
present mismatching interaction behaviour. The proposed adaptation methodology
relies on: (1) the inclusion of behavioural types in component interfaces, to
describe the interaction behaviour of components, (2) a simple high-level
notation for adaptor specification, to express the intended connection between
component interfaces, and (3) a formal definition of adaptor, a
component-in-the-middle capable of making two components interoperate
successfully according to a given specification."

  abstract = {Business processes represent a fundamental asset of a company, as
	they describe the core knowledge underlying its competitive advantage.
	Tools for modeling and analysis of business processes have to cope
	with the increasing complexity of these processes. A view on a process
	intends to abstract from details and make complex processes easier
	to understand. A process view results from specific transformations
	applied to a process model. In this paper we introduce a metamodel
	for process views as well as process viewing patterns, which specify
	elementary transformations to alter an existing process. The patterns
	are presented in a technology independent manner and can be applied
	to any process language that can be represented by a process graph.},

	automated method to structure any process model that belongs to this
	class. This paper fills this gap in the context of acyclic process
	models. The paper defines a necessary and sufficient condition for
	an unstructured process model to have an equivalent structured model
