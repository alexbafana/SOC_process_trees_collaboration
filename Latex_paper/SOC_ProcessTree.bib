abstract="We studied the nature of incident response teams in seven Operations Centers of varying size and types including service providers, a Security Operations Center, a Data Center, and two military training Operations Centers. All responded to incidents by forming teams. We asked: what is the context of incident response work? how can we model incident response work? and what are the implications for tool developers? Activity theory guided our research throughout. Using an ethnographic approach to data collection, we shadowed 129 individuals for a total of 250Â h of observations, conducted 38 interviews, and facilitated 11 meetings with executives of Operations Centers. We produced rich descriptions of the work of operators and a model of incident team formation called the Tailor-made Teams in Operations Centers (T-TOCs). We position our results relative to other ethnographic studies and standards in the industry, showing how incident team formation has changed over time. Today's incident response team is ad hoc, i.e., tailor-made to the circumstances, and responsive to changing circumstances. Our model draws parallels between the incident response work of teams and human cognition. We conclude by pointing out that tools for tailor-made teams are in their infancy.",

abstract = "Abstract Today's Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) operating in critical infrastructures (CIs) are becoming increasingly complex; moreover, they are extensively interconnected with corporate information systems for cost-efficient monitoring, management and maintenance. This exposes \{ICSs\} to modern advanced cyber threats. Existing security solutions try to prevent, detect, and react to cyber threats by employing security measures that typically do not cross the organization's boundaries. However, novel targeted multi-stage attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) take advantage of the interdependency between organizations. By exploiting vulnerabilities of various systems, \{APT\} campaigns intrude several organizations using them as stepping stones to reach the target infrastructure. A coordinated effort to timely reveal such attacks, and promptly deploy mitigation measures is therefore required. Organizations need to cooperatively exchange security-relevant information to obtain a broader knowledge on the current cyber threat landscape and subsequently obtain new insight into their infrastructures and timely react if necessary. Cyber security operation centers (SOCs), as proposed by the European \{NIS\} directive, are being established worldwide to achieve this goal. \{CI\} providers are asked to report to the responsible \{SOCs\} about security issues revealed in their networks. National \{SOCs\} correlate all the gathered data, analyze it and eventually provide support and mitigation strategies to the affiliated organizations. Although many of these tasks can be automated, human involvement is still necessary to enable \{SOCs\} to adequately take decisions on occurring incidents and quickly implement counteractions. In this paper we present a collaborative approach to cyber incident information management for gaining situational awareness on interconnected European CIs. We provide a scenario and an illustrative use-case for our approach; we propose a system architecture for a National SOC, defining the functional components and interfaces it comprises. We further describe the functionalities provided by the different system components to support \{SOC\} operators in performing incident management tasks. "

title="Cooperative detection and protection against network attacks using decentralized information sharing",
journal="Cluster Computing",

volume="13",

pages="67--86",
abstract="Network attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Internet worms, are highly distributed and well coordinated offensive assaults on services, hosts, and the infrastructure of the Internet, and can have disastrous effects including financial losses and disruption of essential services. Consequently, effective defensive countermeasures against these attacks must provide equally sophisticated and well coordinated mechanisms for monitoring, analysis, and response. In this paper, we investigate techniques for cooperative attack detection and countermeasures using decentralized information sharing. The key underlying idea is the use of epidemic algorithms to share attack information and achieve quasi-global knowledge about attack behaviors. This paper first presents a conceptual model that defines the relationships between the level of knowledge in the distributed system and the accuracy of attack detection. The design of a cooperative attack detection and defense framework is then presented, and its use for detecting and defending against DDoS attacks and Internet worms is described. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework against these attacks.",

Methods based on threat trees and Bayesian networks are two well-known approaches to security modeling. However there exist more than 30 DAG-based methodologies, each having different features and goals. The objective of this survey is to summarize the existing methodologies, compare their features, and propose a taxonomy of the described formalisms. This article also supports the selection of an adequate modeling technique depending on user requirements. "

abstract={There is a requirement for improved information sharing and automation in the cyber security domain. Current practices and supporting technologies limit the ability of organizations to take full advantage of their staff's expertise and the trust relationships they have established with each other in their efforts to secure their communication and information systems. Limitations include the lack of interoperable standards, the absence of mechanisms to govern and control the use of sensitive information, and problems validating data quality. While centralized repositories, distribution lists and web services have been adopted in an attempt to address the requirement, the underlying needs are only partly met by these approaches, which do not deliver the required efficiency and effectiveness. Analysis of the specific constraints applicable in the cyber security domain led to definition of the Cyber Security Data Exchange and Collaboration Infrastructure (CDXI) capability. CDXI provides a knowledge management tool for the cyber security domain whose objectives are to facilitate information sharing, enable automation, and facilitate the generation, refinement and vetting of data through burden-sharing collaboration or outsourcing. The capability is defined through a set of high-level requirements that are both necessary and sufficient. This paper describes the high-level requirements and provides a brief description of the work performed to develop the CDXI concept to date as well as planned future work.},
